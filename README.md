# calculatorStarterCode


This project functions as a calculator that performs certain math applications when pluging in numbers. 
It uses java script code and html in order to formulate addition, subtraction, multplication, and other 
math functions through code represented by variables.
If I had more time, i'd most likely edit the look of the calculator and add my own personal touch. i'd 
also add more functions and variables such as natural logs and the value "pi."
